# what does this mean read -p "Enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install (e.g. 1,3,5): " choices

This is a command in a Unix/Linux shell script that prompts the user to enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install. 
The prompt message is "Enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install (e.g. 1,3,5):" and the user's input will be stored in the variable "choices".
For example, if the user enters "1,3,5", the script will interpret this as a request to install packages 1, 3, and 5. 
The script can then use this information to install the selected packages.

# what is -p doing 
The -p option in a Unix/Linux shell command is used to display a prompt message to the user, requesting input. 
In the example command you provided, read -p "Enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install (e.g. 1,3,5): " choices, 
the -p option is used to display the prompt message "Enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install (e.g. 1,3,5): " to the user.
The read command waits for the user to enter input and then stores the input in the variable choices. 
By using the -p option with read, the prompt message is displayed on the same line as the user's input, making it clear what kind of input is expected.

# What does this mean  for choice in $(echo $choices | tr ',' ' ')

This is a for loop in a Unix/Linux shell script that takes the comma-separated list of package numbers entered by the user and iterates over each number, 
storing it in the variable choice.

# Here's what each part of the loop does:

echo $choices: This outputs the contents of the variable choices, which contains the comma-separated list of package numbers entered by the user.

|: This is a pipe symbol, which takes the output of the previous command and "pipes" it as input to the next command.

tr ',' ' ': This command translates (or "transliterates") any commas (',') in the input to spaces (' '). This converts the comma-separated list into a space-separated list, which is easier to work with in a for loop.

$(...): This is a command substitution, which allows the output of a command to be substituted as input to another command.

for choice in ...: This is a for loop that iterates over each item in the space-separated list of package numbers, assigning each item to the variable choice.

Putting it all together, the command for choice in $(echo $choices | tr ',' ' ') takes the user's comma-separated list of package numbers, converts it to a space-separated list, and then loops over each item in the space-separated list, assigning each item to the variable choice. 

This allows the script to install each package selected by the user, one at a time.

# What does this means   case $choice in
    1)

In this particular example, the case statement is used to handle each package number selected by the user, which is stored in the variable $choice. 
The 1) is the start of a pattern block that matches the value "1" when it is tested against the $choice variable. 
The corresponding block of code that follows will be executed if the pattern matches.

# What is  double semi colon used for in the script     
if [ -x "$(command -v mvn)" ]; then

    echo "Maven already installed"
    
else

    apt-get -y install maven
    
    echo "Maven installed"
    
fi

;;

The double semicolon ;; in the shell script is used to indicate the end of a case block. 
It is used to terminate the code block associated with a specific pattern in the case statement.
The ;; is used to mark the end of a case block. 

# The default Pattern to indicate the value entered is not part of the numbers defined in the case

          *)
   
             echo "Invalid selection: $choice"
      
         ;;
   
    esac 
 
done 

esac is used to signal the end of a case statement in a Unix/Linux shell script.
