Case Study: Setting up a Dev Server

# What you are exepected to learn 

This case study tests students' ability to use for loops, prompt for user input, validate input, and install packages using conditional statements. 
The script allows one to modify the prompt and package list to fit their specific needs and test additional skills such as error handling, package 
configuration, and exit status.


# Start of the Case 

You have been tasked with setting up a new dev server for your team. The server will run Ubuntu 20.04 and needs to have the following packages installed:
Git
Maven
OpenJDK 11
Docker
Docker Compose
Ansible
Terraform
Nginx

However, your team only needs some of these packages for their specific projects. You want to create a script that allows your team members to choose which packages 
they want to install.

Write a bash script that prompts the user to select the packages they want to install and installs them using a for loop. Your script should have the following 
requirements:

The script should run as root
The script should check if the selected packages are already installed and skip installation if they are
The script should display a message indicating which packages have been installed
The script should display an error message if an invalid selection is made

Here is an example prompt that you can use:

Which packages would you like to install?
1. Git
2. Maven
3. OpenJDK 11
4. Docker
5. Docker Compose
6. Ansible
7. Terraform
8. Nginx

Enter a comma-separated list of package numbers to install (e.g. 1,3,5):

Your script should allow the user to enter a comma-separated list of package numbers, validate the input, and install the selected packages using a for loop.
Once you have written your script, test it by running it on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 server and selecting different combinations of packages to install.
